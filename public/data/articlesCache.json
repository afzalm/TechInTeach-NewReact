When we learn something new, our brain creates these connections, forming pathways that lead to different memories. However, not all pathways are needed forever. Some memories may fade or become less relevant over time. Synaptic pruning helps our brains get rid of the connections that we don\u2019t use often, making room for new ones. This is part of how our brains stay efficient and organized, ensuring that we can focus on what truly matters while letting go of less important information.\n",

          "excerpt": "The use of readability scores, such as the Dale-Chall readability score and the Flesch score, has been fairly widespread in schools across the world as a way of evaluating the difficulty of texts and determining the appropriate level of difficulty for different age groups and reading abilities. These scores are often used to evaluate materials such as textbooks, children\u2019s books, and instructional materials, as well as to assess the effectiveness of different teaching methods and materials.\n",

However, it is important to approach the use of AI in this context with caution and to consider the unique needs and abilities of each individual student. It is also important to recognize that AI algorithms are not a substitute for professional evaluation and assessment by qualified educators and other professionals, and to use AI as one tool among many in identifying children who may be in need of special education services.\n",
